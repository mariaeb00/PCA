# Principle Component Analysis
This is a basic R script for analyzing and visualizing genetic relationships among samples using a SNP distance matrix. 
The workflow performs dimensionality reduction and identifies the optimal number of genetic clusters to produce a visual to show the clustering of samples 
based on pairwise SNP distances.
